# JAVA SWING STUDENT MANAGER LINUX UI

For my class assignment, I wanted to make the task of building a management app more fun. Instead of making apps with a dull design for managing students, users, employees, and libraries,... I decided to mix student management with a Linux-style user interface. 

This approach made the project more exciting and gave me a chance to be creative with different ideas.

- **JDK**: 17
  
- **IDE**: Apache NetBeans IDE 15

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying the [Config.java](https://github.com/56duong/java-swing-student-manager-linux-ui/blob/master/src/ps20250nguyenngocthuyduong/config/Config.java) file. Here are some of the configurations you might need to change:

- **Run SQL Script**: To set up the database, you need to run the SQL script provided in FPOLY_DaoTao.sql.

1. Open your SQL client tool.
2. Connect to your SQL Server database.
3. Execute the SQL script FPOLY_DaoTao.sql to create the necessary database tables and schema.


- **Configure Database Connection**: Navigate to the [Config.java](https://github.com/56duong/java-swing-student-manager-linux-ui/blob/master/src/ps20250nguyenngocthuyduong/config/Config.java) and update the configuration settings with your database credentials. Example:

```bash package ps20250ngocthuyduong.config;

public class Config {
    public static final String SQLSERVER_USERNAME = "sa";
    public static final String SQLSERVER_PASSWORD = "yourPassword"; // Update with your password
    public static final String SQLSERVER_DATABASE_NAME = "FPOLY_DaoTao";
    public static final Integer SQLSERVER_DATABASE_PORT = 1433;
}
```


## üöÄ Running the Application

Start the application and log in with the default credentials:
```bash
username: admin
password: admin
```
